# Spring Distributed Lock
Spring Integration is a module within the Spring framework that provides support for integrating different components and systems in a distributed environment.

In a distributed environment, it is not possible to implement pessimistic and optimistic lock configurations without acquiring locks or some form of synchronization mechanism. Locking is essential to ensure data consistency and prevent conflicts when multiple nodes or machines are involved.
